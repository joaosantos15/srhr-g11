# Protocol

Type: Between subjects

### Research Question 
How does the introduction of a robot affect children's story recollection abilities?

### Independent variable
**Story delivery method**:
1. Robot telling the story
2. Tablet reading the story

### Dependent variable
Story recollection. A score based on:
- Mentioned characters
- Core ideas
- Mentioned events
- Accurate details
- Inaccurate details

### Procedure
- Consent forms will be distributed so the children's parents can sign
- Participants will be segregated by age into two groups, the group of the 4 years old and 5 years old. In each of these groups, each participant will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, group A and group B. The group A of the 4 years old group will be merged with the group A of the 5 years old. The same applies to group B. This will ensure that groups have good age distribution.
- Each session will last approximately 20 minutes. 
    - 10 minutes of interaction with the robot
    - 10 minutes being interviewed to access their story recollection.
- Participants will be escorted to a room where the interaction will take place by one of the investigators. 
- Before the experiment they will be told what is expected of them.
- One investigator will be monitoring the interaction for the safety of the participant, but not in its line of sight.
- After the interaction with the robot, participants will be escorted to a second room, where the interview will take place.
